## NCBI_GSM.py

NCBI_GSM.py is a scrip for grepping the information from the NCBI database. Since the format per GSE is so different. So you need to change the code to fit your purpose. Since the IP will probably be locked or limited by the NCBI because of frequency requests, I didn't apply the multiprocessing on here.
